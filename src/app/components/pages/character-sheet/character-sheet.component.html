        <p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strength</b>, measuring physical power</li>
            <li><b>Dexterity</b>, measuring agility</li>
            <li><b>Constitution</b>, measuring endurance</li>
            <li><b>Intelligence</b>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>
            <li><b>Wisdom</b>, measuring perception and insight</li>
            <li><b>Charisma</b>, measuring force of personality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities--a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game -- the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll -- rely on the six ability scores. The Introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p>
